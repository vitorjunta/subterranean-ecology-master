This repository contains scripts and analyses developed during my **Master's research** on the ecology of subterranean invertebrates.  
The work aims to understand how **habitat traits** – including physical, trophic, and microclimatic attributes – influence **community composition and species richness**, contributing to the **conservation of subterranean environments**.

## 🔬 Research Overview

### 1️⃣ Regional-scale study
- Evaluated **24 caves in the Santana region, Bahia, Brazil**.  
- Assessed how **habitat attributes** affect invertebrate communities.  
- Identified key factors shaping **community composition and species richness**.

### 2️⃣ Local-scale study (Gruta do Padre)
- Focused on the **fifth largest cave in Brazil**.  
- The cave was identified as a **new Hotspot for Subterranean Biodiversity** with **25 strictly subterranean species**.  
- Identified multiple areas inside the same cave and how this could shape communities.
