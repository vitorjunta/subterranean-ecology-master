This folder contains scripts, data, and results from the **regional-scale study** conducted on **24 caves in the Santana region, Bahia, Brazil**, focused on understanding how **environmental traits** drives **community composition and species richness** of subterranean invertebrates.

## ðŸ”¬ Research Overview

### Sampling Design
- **Transects (mesoscale):** 122 transects of 10 Ã— 3 m each, distributed along cave floors from entrances to deeper regions.  
- **Quadrats (micro-scale):** 366 quadrats (1 mÂ² each) placed in triplicates inside the transects.  
- **Invertebrate sampling:** Visual search conducted first in quadrats, then along the entire transect. Three collectors sampled until all invertebrates were accounted for.  
- **Special searches:** Additional intuitive searches in cave sections to detect troglobitic and stygobitic species.  
- **Preservation & identification:** Specimens preserved in 70% ethanol, sorted in the lab under a stereomicroscope, and identified to the lowest taxonomic level possible. Potential troglobitic species were identified by **troglomorphic traits** (e.g., pigmentation, eye reduction, appendage elongation). Experts were consulted when necessary.  
- **Vouchers:** Deposited at the **Collection of Subterranean Invertebrates of Lavras (ISLA, UFLA)**.

### Environmental Traits
- **Substrate mapping:** Transects divided into 10 segments (1 Ã— 3 m). Organic and inorganic substrate areas quantified visually. For the quadrats the substrates were later analyzed using **ImageJ**.  
- **Climatic measurements:** Humidity and temperature measured using a digital thermo-hygrometer placed at the center of each transect.  
- **Distances:** Measured with laser tape and mapped using QGIS.
